# Changelog

All notable changes to Pingogram are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the project uses
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

The release workflow copies the section for the tagged version into the GitHub Release notes,
so keep headings exactly in the form `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD`.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Project scaffold, documentation, CI, TDLib and release workflows.
- Gradle project: version catalog, `build-logic` convention plugins, Gradle 9.8.1 wrapper and the

  AGP 9.4.1, Kotlin 2.4.21, Compose BOM 2026.09.00; `foss`/`gms` flavors; app version and
  per-ABI version codes from `-Pversion`.
