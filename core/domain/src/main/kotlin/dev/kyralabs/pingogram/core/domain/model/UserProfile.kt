 * What a user's profile shows beyond their [User] (`REQUIREMENTS.md` FR-P2, `UserProfileRepository`), as TDLib's

 * and a bot's description. TDLib reads it from the server when first asked, then keeps it and reports its changes.
 *
 * `toString()` leaves the bio, the birthday and the description out, so it can be logged.
 *
 * @property bio the user's bio with its links and mentions; empty without one, and always for bots.
 * @property birthdate the birthday the user shares with the current user; null if they share none.
 * @property isBlocked the user is on the current user's main block list (`BlockListRepository`).
 * @property botDescription what a bot says about itself, for its profile; null for users who are no bots.
 * @property groupsInCommon how many groups and channels the current user shares with the user.
 * @property canBeCalled the user's privacy settings let the current user call them (td_api.tl `can_be_called`).
 * @property supportsVideoCalls the user's app takes video calls (td_api.tl `supports_video_calls`).
 * @property personalChatId the channel the user shows on their profile (td_api.tl `personal_chat_id`); 0 for none.
