/**
 * Layout dimensions beyond the spacing scale (`docs/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` §7). Feature modules use these instead of
 * `dp` literals (and of fractions of the window), through [MaterialTheme.sizes].
 *
 * @property contentMaxWidth the widest a single column of content gets (forms, onboarding, a list on its own),
 *   centered on medium and wider windows so lines and fields stay comfortable; the width of an M3 dialog.
 * @property illustrationMaxSize the largest side of a hero illustration or a QR code frame.
 * @property headlineBadge the side of a `MaterialShapes` badge with an icon above a headline, e.g. on every login step
 *   (`docs/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` §3.3); its icon takes half of it.
 * @property avatarSmall an `Avatar` in a one- or two-line list item: contacts, members, search results (the M3 list
 *   item's leading avatar).
 * @property avatarRow an `Avatar` in a chat list row, next to a title and a one-line preview (`docs/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`
 *   §7: between Material's 40 dp list avatar and [avatarMedium], so photos stay recognizable in a dense list).
 * @property avatarMedium an `Avatar` on the account's card at the top of Settings.
 * @property avatarLarge an `Avatar` heading a screen on its own: the profile photo in Edit profile.
 * @property avatarProfile the `Avatar` heading a user's profile, under its large flexible top bar, as large as Google
 *   Contacts' contact photo.
 * @property profilePhotoItem the side of a photo in the profile's carousel of profile photos (square, as Telegram
 *   keeps them).
 * @property sharedMediaCell the smallest cell of a photo or video in the grid of a profile's shared media: three
 *   across a phone, more on wider panes.
 * @property avatarExtraSmall an `Avatar` beside the last of a group of messages in a group chat, next to its bubble.
 * @property avatarRing the width of a ring around an `Avatar`, and of the gap that sets it off from the avatar, e.g.
 *   the ring in `primary` around the account's avatar on its card in Settings.
 * @property avatarBadge the diameter of a small round badge over an `Avatar`'s bottom end, e.g. the edit badge on the
 *   account's avatar in Settings, holding an icon of [badgeIcon].
 * @property inlineIcon an icon within a line of title text, e.g. the badges and mute icon after a chat's name.
 * @property inlineIconSmall an icon next to label text, e.g. read receipts beside a time, or a chat's pin.
 * @property badgeIcon an icon inside a `Badge`, e.g. the `@` of an unread mention; the size of a badge's digits.
 * @property inlineProgressIndicator an indeterminate progress indicator within a line of `labelLarge` text, e.g. in
 *   the chat list's connection pill.
 * @property textBlockPadding how far the rounded background of inline code, a code block or a hidden spoiler reaches
 *   past its text at either end, so the glyphs keep clear of its corners.
 * @property bubbleMaxWidthFraction the widest a message bubble gets, as a fraction of the conversation's width, so
 *   incoming and outgoing bubbles stay apart.
 * @property bubbleMaxWidth the widest a message bubble gets on wide windows, where [bubbleMaxWidthFraction] would make
 *   lines too long to read comfortably; the width of [contentMaxWidth].
 * @property reactionBadge the smallest a reaction's round badge on a bubble's corner gets: its diameter with one emoji.
 *   Its touch target is 48 dp nonetheless, reaching past it without taking room.
 * @property reactionBadgeRing the ring in the conversation's background color around a reaction badge, which sets it
 *   off from the bubble it overlaps.
 * @property reactionTile the width of a reaction with its count in the reactions picker's carousel of a message's
 *   reactions, at 100% font scale.
 * @property swipeReplyDistance how far a bubble is swiped toward the end to reply to it: released past it, the reply
 *   starts.
 * @property messageMenuBlur the blur radius of the conversation behind a message lifted for its actions (API 31+).
 * @property messageMenuMinWindowHeight the shortest window that lifts a long-pressed message with its menu beside it;
 *   shorter ones (phones in landscape) show its actions in a bottom sheet. Material's lower bound of medium heights.
 * @property mediaMaxWidth the widest a photo, a video or an album gets in a message, and the width of a poll: on a
 *   phone more than [bubbleMaxWidthFraction] leaves, so media fill a bubble as wide as text may make it.
 * @property mediaMaxHeight the tallest a photo or a video gets in a message.
 * @property mediaMinSize the shortest side of a photo or a video in a message: panoramas and tall screenshots are
 *   cropped to it rather than shown as slivers.
 * @property mediaAlbumGap the gap between the photos and videos of an album.
 * @property playBadge the round badge on a video's or a GIF's thumbnail that says it plays.
 * @property sticker the square a sticker fits in, keeping its aspect ratio.
 * @property largeEmoji the square an emoji shown on its own fits in: an animated emoji, a die.
 * @property videoNote the diameter of a round video message.
 * @property contentIcon the circle behind the icon of a document, a location, a game or a story in a message.
 * @property waveformMinWidth the width of the waveform of a short voice message; longer ones get wider, up to
 *   [waveformMaxWidth] for a minute and more.
 * @property waveformMaxWidth the width of the waveform of a voice message of a minute or more.
 * @property waveformHeight the height of a voice message's waveform: its loudest bars.
 * @property waveformBarWidth the width of one bar of a voice message's waveform.
 * @property waveformBarGap the gap between two bars of a voice message's waveform.
 * @property attachmentPreview the square of a picked photo or video in the preview before it is sent.
 * @property fabSmall the height of a small extended floating action button and of the FAB it collapses to (Material 3
 *   Expressive's, 56 dp, as Gmail's Compose; material3 has no public token for it): the room a list leaves at its end,
 *   so its last row can scroll clear of one.
 * @property floatingNavigationBar the height of the floating navigation bar's pill and of the search button beside it,
 *   as Google Photos' (`docs/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` §6.1): the floating toolbar's 64 dp less its 8 dp of padding.
 * @property denseTopAppBar the height of the small top app bar over the dense lists of the Chats and Contacts tabs and
 *   the archive (`docs/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` §7, Density): Material's compact top app bar, 8 dp lower than its default.
 * @property pinPadMaxWidth the widest the passcode lock's keypad gets, so its keys stay within a thumb's reach.
 * @property passcodeDot the diameter of a dot that stands for an entered digit of a passcode.
 * @property composerField the height of the conversation composer's text field at one line, a filled tonal pill like
 *   Google Messages' (`docs/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` §6), as tall as the round send button beside it, and of the recording
 *   bar in its place.
 * @property recordingDot the dot that shows a voice message is being recorded, as loud as the microphone.
 * @property recordingCancelDistance how far the finger slides toward the start, holding the microphone, to cancel.
 * @property recordingLockDistance how far it slides up to lock the recording, which then goes on hands-free.
 * @property inputPanelHeight the height of the emoji and sticker panel above the navigation bar until the keyboard has
 *   shown once; then the panel takes the keyboard's height, so switching between them moves nothing.
 * @property panelEmoji the smallest cell of an emoji in the panel's grid: a 48 dp touch target.
 * @property panelSticker the smallest cell of a sticker in the panel's grid: five on a phone.
 * @property panelStickerCover the picture of a sticker set on its button in the panel's row of sets.
 * @property leadingIconContainer the tonal circle behind a settings row's leading icon, as in Android 16's Settings:
 *   the size of Material's leading avatar in a list item, so rows keep their heights.
 * @property keyImageOutline the outline around a secret chat's key image, which sets its square off from its frame
 *   whatever the colors of its edge pixels.
 * @property pinnedIndicator the width of the pinned messages bar's segments, one per pinned message, that show which
 *   one the bar shows.
